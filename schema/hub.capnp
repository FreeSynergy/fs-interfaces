# FreeSynergy hub contract — DRAFT 0.1 (ADR 0019, 0021, 0029).
#
# STATUS: DRAFT (ADR 0045). Owner program: fs-hub. Consumers: fs-hub-client (programs that register
# with the hub: fs-tasks, fs-calendar ... as they adopt it); 1 of 2 independent users so far.
#
# Evolution rules: only append fields/methods, never renumber, never reuse an ordinal.
